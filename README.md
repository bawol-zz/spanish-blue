First attempt at creating a game. It's a tile based game similar to Azul by Michael Kiesling and released by Plan B Games. 

I'm working on the mechanics before getting into making the graphical elements. I realized it's probably better to make a Player class rather than get all the stuff jumbled into multiple dictionaries and shit. Total beginner.
